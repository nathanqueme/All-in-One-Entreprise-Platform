## Background
*At 18, after graduating from high school and before starting university, I dedicated a year to building a fully open-source platform, available as a <u><strong>WEB APP, iOS APP, AND ANDROID APP.</strong></u>*  

*This platform empowers businesses to share information internally with customers while:*  
- *retaining data ownership* 
- *remaining ad-free*
- *maintaining minimal cost*
