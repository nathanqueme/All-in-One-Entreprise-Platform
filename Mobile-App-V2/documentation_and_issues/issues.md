When we create an account, then delete it. And recreate a new one. It loads the profile page of the previous one --> the issue may come from the cached session or from the signUpValues  



When the created account 's profile page is open just after its creaation the tabs buttons measures are not initialized so the indicator is invisible. It's only by typing on "In the place" or "About" that it initializes it.
