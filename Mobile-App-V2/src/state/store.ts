/*
The app needs to be able to let users re-open the same page 10 times and manage the UI independently for each one.
-> The pages and their UI are all uniquely indentified but the data loading may be shared. 

-> The user opens an account -> the UI is in loading appearance -> Once loaded the user re-opens the same account from a post -> The app opens the page -> The page is in loading appearance... The app needs to handle this as many times as the user wants. 


Data structure to handle it : 
postCategories : [ PagePostCategories(page_id: 1, account_id: 'XBV', postCategories: null | [] | [...])   , ... ]            

Each page via its page_id, tracks change of its typeof 'postCategories' to know once they are loaded -> (null) is not loaded and an empty or filled array is loaded ([] or [...])
