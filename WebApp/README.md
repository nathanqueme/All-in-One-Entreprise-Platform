This repository, contains the source code of AtSight's web version, which you can discover at : https://atsight.fr/george6paris

Technologies used in this repository include: Redux, Typescript, AWS, React and Tailwind CSS. This repository also contains a small Analytics tool that I built, which is similar to gtag.js.
